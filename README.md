# Master Works
Here, I present some of the works developed by me during my master's training.

Some works are just for reference, since I exported some features from external sources (as refered) to learn more about some concepts, 
and sometimes to implement them in my research in the future. 

You can find notebooks of random physics concepts, some topics used by me in course presentations, and a simplified
view of the numerical methods I developed to explore temporal properties of quantum mechanics. 

Hope you enjoy! 



 If you have any problem or doubt during the local execution of some of those files, you can always contact me on one of my emails
